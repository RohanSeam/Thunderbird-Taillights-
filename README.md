# Thunderbird-Taillights-

In this lab, we were given a scenario where we needed to create a circuit that follows the tail light pattern of an older model Ford thunderbird. The pattern that we were required to follow was one that when the left turn signal was activated, the innermost left light would be on, followed by the inner two, and finally all 3. Then, it would return to the idle state where all the lights would be off, and the pattern would reset. We followed the same pattern for the right tail light as well. When hazards are activated, no matter what state the circuit is in, the circuit should reset to the idle state and then go to the hazard state which means all lights are on, then alternate between idle and all lights on. We were introduced to the concept of finite state machines and how they can benefit us with circuit design and implementation of this circuit. We also used online tools to help us simplify our logic to simplify our circuit. Finally, we used ModelSIm and Logisim to simulate our designed circuit.
